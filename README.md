# LPC2148-ADC-Interrupt-LCD
This project demonstrates ADC interfacing with the LPC2148 ARM7 microcontroller using interrupt-driven conversion. It reads analog input from ADC channel 2 (AD0.2), processes the data in an interrupt service routine (ISR), and displays the 10-bit digital value on a 16x2 LCD in 4-bit mode.
